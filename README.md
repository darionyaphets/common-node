# Common Node

This package implements a number of [CommonJS](http://www.commonjs.org) proposals on top of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) using [node-fibers](https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers). Fibers are used to emulate multi-threading within a single process, allowing one to use a synchronous programming style and as a result:

* write fast CRUD webapps that run on Node.js without callback spaghetti
* run webapps, middleware and libraries written for [RingoJS](http://ringojs.org) and [other implementations](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Implementations)
* mix & match synchronous/asynchronous styles and use the best tool for the job by writing maintainable business logic in a synchronous manner
* write concise, legible shell scripts

The following modules are included:

* assert - [Unit Testing/1.0](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Unit_Testing/1.0) & a suite for running tests
* console - [Console](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Console) - partial implementation available in Node
* system - [System/1.0](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/System/1.0) & methods for managing "threads" and child processes
* binary - [Binary/B](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Binary/B)
* io - [IO/A](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/IO/A), including a `ByteArray` backed `MemoryStream`
* fs - [Filesystem/A](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Filesystem/A) (partial implementation)
* jsgi - [JSGI 0.3](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/JSGI/Level0/A/Draft2)
* httpclient - [HTTP Client/A](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/HTTP_Client/A)

### Installation

If you don't already have them, [install Node](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation) and the [Node Package Manager npm](http://npmjs.org):

    curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh

Using `npm` install a global copy of `node-fibers` as root:

    sudo npm install -g fibers 

To install the latest version of `common-node`, clone the repository (an npm package will be made available once we have a stable release):

    git clone git://github.com/olegp/common-node.git

Change to the package directory and run the "Hello World" example server:

    cd common-node; node-fibers examples/hello.js

To test that it's working as expected, make an HTTP request from another prompt:

    curl http://localhost:8080/

To install `common-node` as a global package:

    sudo npm -g install .

### Examples

A number of examples are available in [common-node/examples](https://github.com/olegp/common-node/tree/master/examples):

  * `hello.js` - Hello World webapp using JSGI to return a simple text response
  * `static.js` - streams a static file as a response
  * `http.js` - makes an HTTP request to another server and returns the result in the response
  * `sleep.js` -  sleeps for one second before returning a response
  * `spawn.js` -  spawns a new fiber which prints to stdout ten seconds after processing a request

For more usage examples, please refer to the tests in the  [common-node/test](https://github.com/olegp/common-node/tree/master/test) directory.

### Documentation

The API reference is available at <http://olegp.github.com/common-node/doc/>

### Tests

To run the unit tests execute the following command:

    node-fibers test/all.js

You can also run individual tests, for example:

    node-fibers test/io.js

### Benchmarks

Although `common-node` is optimized for developer efficiency rather than performance, a number of benchmarks are included in [common-node/benchmarks](https://github.com/olegp/common-node/tree/master/benchmarks). A `common-node` version and an asynchronous version using Connect of each benchmark are provided. Results of these benchmarks will be included below.

  * hello 
  * static
